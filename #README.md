# ðŸš— Car Dataset Cleaning - Task 1

## ðŸ“Œ Objective

The purpose of this task was to clean and prepare dataset for analysis. The dataset included information such as car names, manufacturing year, fuel type, mileage, engine size, power, etc. The cleaning process ensures the data is consistent, reliable, and ready for analysis or modeling.

## ðŸ§¼ Cleaning Summary

### 1. **Initial Exploration**
- Explored the dataset to understand its structure and contents.
- Identified null values, duplicates, and columns with inconsistent formatting.

### 2. **Missing Value Handling**
- Removed all rows that contained any missing data to ensure consistency in further analysis.

### 3. **Duplicate Removal**
- Identified and removed duplicate records from the dataset.

### 4. **Text Standardization**
- Standardized text-based categorical columns (e.g., fuel type and seller type) by converting all entries to lowercase and removing extra spaces.

### 5. **Numeric Conversion**
- Converted string representations of numeric values (like mileage, engine capacity, and max power) into proper numeric data types after removing unit suffixes.
- This allows for numerical operations and statistical analysis on these fields.

### 6. **Column Name Standardization**
- Renamed all column names to follow a consistent format: lowercase with underscores instead of spaces.

### 7. **Final Output and Summary**
- Saved the cleaned dataset as a new CSV file.
- Verified the cleaned data by inspecting random samples and generating descriptive statistics.

## âœ… Outcome

- Cleaned dataset is free from missing values and duplicates.
- All text and numeric columns are properly formatted and standardized.
- Dataset is now analysis-ready for tasks like data visualization, modeling, or reporting.
